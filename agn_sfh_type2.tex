\begin{abstract}
%We present the results of the first observational population study of the effects of AGN on the star formation history (SFH) of their host galaxies. A new Bayesian software \starpy ~~allows for the investigation of the SFH as two parameters $[t_q, \tau]$ given an observed optical and NUV colour of a galaxy. The output provides a 2D likelihood distribution in the parameter space which is combined across the populations of AGN host galaxies and compared with that for inactive galaxies. We find that galaxies currently hosting an AGN have undergone very recent rapid quenching across all galaxy masses. This is not seen in those galaxies not currently hosting an AGN. Downsizing, whilst apparent for the inactive galaxies is a secondary effect to that of the impact of the AGN on the SFH of their host galaxies particularly for lower mass galaxies. We speculate that this can all be attributed to the gas reservoirs available for both star formation and feeding the black hole in the evolutionary lifetime of the galaxy.\footnotemark[1]

%BASIC INTRO

%A black hole resides at the centre of every galaxy in the Universe wherein it co-evolves with it's host. Despite its relatively small size, an active black hole (active galactic nucleus; AGN) can have an impact on the evolution of its host galaxy through the feedback of energy into the galaxy system.    
%MORE DETAILED
%The largest fraction of AGN are commonly found in the `green valley', suggesting a relation between the AGN and the suppression (quench) of star formation, causing the galaxy to transition from the star forming `blue cloud' to the dead `red sequence'.
%GENERAL PROBLEM
%Though observational evidence has been found for both positive and negative feedback caused by an AGN, the effect on the galaxy wide star formation history (SFH) due to the presence of an AGN has not been studied.
%MAIN RESULT
%Here 
We present a population study of the star formation history (SFH) of $1,244$ Type 2 AGN host galaxies, compared to $123,243$ inactive galaxies using a Bayesian method. We find evidence for the Type 2 AGN host galaxies having undergone a recent and rapid drop in their star formation rate. AGN feedback is therefore important at least for this population of galaxies.
%RESULT COMPARISON
This result is not seen for the inactive galaxies whose SFHs are dominated by the effects of downsizing at earlier epochs, a secondary effect for the AGN host galaxies. We show that rapid quenching histories cannot account fully for the quenching of all the star formation across the population of AGN host galaxies and that slower quenching histories, attributed to non-violent processes of evolution are also key in their evolution.
%RESULTS IN GENERAL CONTEXT
This is in agreement with recent results showing both merger-driven and non-merger processes are contributing to the co-evolution of galaxies and super massive black holes. The availability of gas in the reservoirs of a galaxy, and it's ability to be replenished, appears to be the key driver behind this co-evolution.\footnotemark[1]

\section{Introduction}

%Two open issues in modern astrophysics are: (i) how do galaxies and their central black holes co-evolve and (ii) what are the effects, if any, of AGN feedback. There is an obvious relationship between the mass of a central black hole and its host galaxy, commonly referred to as the Maggorian relationship \citep{Mag98, MH03, HR04}. 
The nature of the observed co-evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes \citep{Mag98, MH03, HR04} and the effects of AGN feedback on galaxies are two of the most important open issues in galaxy evolution. AGN feedback was first suggested as a mechanism for regulating star formation in simulations \citep{Croton06, Bower06, Somer08} and some indirect evidence has been observed for both positive and negative feedback in various systems (see the comprehensive review from \citealt{Fab06}). 

The strongest observational evidence for AGN feedback is that the largest fraction of AGN are found in the green valley \citep{CB08, Hickox09, Sch2010}, suggesting some link between AGN activity and  the process of quenching which moves a galaxy from the blue cloud to the red sequence. However, concrete statistical evidence for the effect of AGN feedback on the host galaxy population has so far, been elusive. 

Here we present a large observational population study of the quenching of the host galaxies of Type 2 AGN identified by line diagnostics. We use a new Bayesian method\footnote{Publicly available: \url{http://github.com/zooniverse/starpy}} to effectively model the SFH of a galaxy with two parameters, time of quenching, $t$, and exponential rate, $\tau$, given the observed near ultra-violet (NUV) and optical colours. We aim to determine the following: (i) Are galaxies currently hosting an AGN undergoing quenching? (ii) If so, when and at what rate does this quenching occur? (iii) Is this quenching occurring at different times and rates to a control sample of inactive galaxies?

The zero points of all magnitudes are in the AB system and where necessary, we adopt the WMAP Seven-Year Cosmology (Jarosik et al. 2011) with $(\Omega_m , ~\Omega_\lambda , ~h) = (0.26, 0.73, 0.71)$.


\section{Data \& Methods}

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{bpt/mosaic_agn_type_2_blue_one_line_4.pdf}
\caption{Randomly selected SDSS \emph{gri} composite images from the sample of $1,244$ Type 2 AGN in a redshift range $0.04 < z < 0.05$.  The galaxies are ordered from least to most featured according to their debiased `disc or featured' vote fraction, $p_d$ (see \citealt{GZ2}). The scale for each image is $0.099~\rm{arcsec/pixel}$.}
\label{mosaic}
\end{figure*}

In this investigation we use visual classifications of galaxy morphologies from the Galaxy Zoo 2\footnote{\url{http://zoo2.galaxyzoo.org/}} (GZ2) citizen science project \citep{GZ2}, which obtains multiple independent classifications for each optical image. The full question tree for an image is shown in Figure 1 of \citeauthor{GZ2}  The GZ2 project used $304, 022$ images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8 (SDSS; \citealt{York2000, Aihara11}) all classified by \emph{at least} 17 independent users, with a mean number of classifications of $\sim42$.

Further to this, we required NUV photometry from the GALEX survey, within which $\sim42\%$ of the GZ2 sample was observed, giving $126, 316$ galaxies total ($0.01 < z < 0.25$). This will be referred to as the \textsc{gz2-galex} sample. The completeness of this sample ($-22 < M_u < -15$) is shown in Figure 2 of \cite{Sme2015} with the $u$-band absolute magnitude against redshift for this sample in comparison to the SDSS data set. 

%Typical Milky Way $L_*$ galaxies with $M_u \sim -20.5$ are still included in the GZ2 subsample out to the highest redshift of $z \sim 0.25$; however dwarf and lower mass galaxies are only detected at the lowest redshifts. 



\subsection{STARPY}\label{starpy}

\textsc{starpy}\footnote{Publicly available: \url{http://github.com/zooniverse/starpy}} is a \textsc{python} code which allows the user to derive the quenched star formation history (SFH) of a galaxy through a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with the input of the observed $u-r$ and $NUV-u$ colours, a redshift, and the use of the stellar population models of \cite{BC03}. The star formation history template is an exponential decline of the SFR and is described by two parameters $[t_q, \tau]$, where $t_q$ is the time at which the onset of quenching begins $\rm{[Gyr]}$ and $\tau$ is the exponential rate at which quenching occurs $\rm{[Gyr]}$. Under the simplifying assumption that all galaxies formed at $t=0$ $\rm{ Gyr}$ with an initial burst of star formation, the SFH can be described as: 
\begin{equation}\label{sfh}
SFR =
\begin{cases}
i_{sfr}(t_q) & \text{if } t < t_q \\
i_{sfr}(t_q) \times exp{\left( \frac{-(t-t_{q})}{\tau}\right)} & \text{if } t > t_q 
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $i_{sfr}$ is an initial constant star formation rate dependent on $t_q$ \citep{Sch2014, Sme2015}.  A smaller $\tau$ value corresponds to a rapid quench, whereas a larger $\tau$ value corresponds to a slower quench. The output of \starpy  ~ is probabilistic in nature and provides the posterior probability distribution across the entirety of the two parameter space for each individual galaxy. The probabilistic fitting methods to this SFH for an observed galaxy are described in full detail in \cite{Sme2015} wherein the \starpy ~~code was used to characterise the SFHs of the \textsc{gz2-galex} sample. 

%These individual galaxy likelihoods can be combined to visualise the areas of high probability in the model parameter space for a given population of galaxies (e.g. the green valley as in \citealt{Sme2015} and here with active and inactive galaxies). The GZ2 data also provides uniquely powerful continuous measurements of a galaxyÕs morphology, therefore we utilise the user vote fractions to obtain separate model likelihood parameter distributions for both smooth and disc galaxies; obtained by weighting by the morphology vote fraction of each galaxy when combined. We stress that this portion of the methodology is a non-Bayesian visualisation of the combined individual galaxy results for each population.


\subsection{AGN Sample}\label{agnsample}

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{bpt/GZ2_GALEX_sample_bpt_diagram_SNR_gtr_3_type_1_seyferts_only.png}
\caption{BPT diagrams for galaxies in the \textsc{gz2-galex} sample (black crosses) with S/N $> 3$ for each emission line. Inequalities defined in: \cite{Kew01} to separate SF galaxies from AGN (dashed lines), \cite{Kauff03b} to separate SF from composite SF-AGN galaxies (solid line) and \cite{Kew06} to separate LINERS and Seyferts (dotted lines). Galaxies are included in the \textsc{agn-host} sample (red circles) if they satisfy all the inequalities to be classified as Seyferts. LINERs are excluded for purity.}
\label{bpt}
\end{figure*}


We selected Type 2 AGN using a BPT diagram \citep{bpt81} using line and continuum strengths for [OIII], [NII], [SII] and [OII] obtained from the MPA-JHU catalogue \citep{Kauff03, Brinch04} which matched those in the \textsc{gz2-galex}; we then required the S/N $> 3$ for each emission line as in \cite{Sch2010}. Those galaxies which satisfied all of the inequalities defined in \cite{Kew01}, \cite{Kauff03b} and \cite{Kew06} were selected as Type 2 AGN, giving $1,244$ host galaxies ($\sim9\%$ of the \textsc{gz2-galex} sample). \cite{Sarzi10, RB12} and \cite{Singh13} have all demonstrated that LINERs are not powered by AGN, therefore for purity, we excluded these galaxies from the sample ($55$ galaxies in total) with no change to the results. This will be referred to as the \textsc{agn-host} sample. 

Images from SDSS for ten randomly selected Type 2 AGN host galaxies from this sample are shown in Figure \ref{mosaic} and the entire sample is shown in Figure \ref{bpt} with those galaxies selected as Type 2 AGN marked in red and the rest of the \textsc{gz2-galex} in black.  For this sample the mean $\log L[OIII] \sim 45.0$ and median $\log L[OIII] \sim 44.7$, with a range of $\log L[OIII]$ luminosities of $42.9-46.7$. 

%All of the galaxies satisfying any of the inequalities defined in \cite{Kew01} are removed from the \textsc{gz2-galex} sample along with any of those identified as Type 1 AGN by \citet{Oh15} to produce a largely inactive sample of typical galaxies. These inactive galaxies are used as a control sample to the Type 2 AGN sample and will be referred to as the \textsc{inactive} sample. 

We constructed a sample of inactive galaxies by removing from the \textsc{gz2-galex} sample all galaxies in the \txtsc{agn-host} sample, as well as sources identified as Type 1 AGN by the presence of broad emission lines \citep{Oh15}. We refer to this sample as the \textsc{inactive} sample. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test revealed the redshift distributions of the \textsc{inactive} and \textsc{agn-host} samples are statistically indistinguishable. 

Since this investigation is focussed on whether an AGN can have an impact on the SF of its host galaxy, we must consider whether there is a selection effect present in this identification method. The extent to which SF could be obscured by AGN emission was addressed by \cite{Sch2010}. They showed, through a simple empirical experiment which simulated the addition of an AGN of certain luminosity to a star forming galaxy, that BPT-based selection of AGN produces a complete sample, even in the blue cloud, at luminosities of $L[OIII] > 10^{40} erg~s^{-1}$. Above this limit we therefore assume we have selected a complete sample of AGN independent of host galaxy SFR.

Type 2 AGN were used in this analysis as opposed to Type 1 due to their photometric obscuration. Type 1 AGN contaminate their galaxy's photometric measurements which would need to be removed through aperture matching. Due to the requirement for NUV colours from GALEX, in order to be sensitive to any recent star formation, the aperture matching to SDSS becomes a non-trivial task. 

\cite{Simmons11} showed that the obscuration of a Type 2 AGN is more efficient in the NUV than in the optical. Residual NUV light from the AGN can be neglected in comparison to that of the galaxy, however there is often some residual optical light that can affect the measurements of the host galaxy's photometry. We can subtract this central optical AGN flux using the PSF magnitudes provided by SDSS, however the change in the colours of these galaxies after this correction is negligible, with $\Delta(u-r) \sim 0.09$. We therefore use the uncorrected colours to avoid unnecessary complexity and minimise the propagation of errors in the the SFH likelihoods. Including these corrected colours does not change the results described below. We also split both the \textsc{agn-host} and \textsc{inactive} samples into low, medium and high masses (see Table \ref{massbins}) to control for any degeneracies. Masses were calculated using the $u-r$ colour and absolute r-band magnitude with the method outlined in \cite{Baldry06}.


\section{Results}

%Each galaxy was run through \starpy ~ to obtain a 2-dimensional likelihood distribution across the $[t_q, \tau]$ parameter space. The individual likelihood distributions of each galaxy were combined across the three mass bins defined in Secition \ref{agnsample} for the \textsc{agn-host} and \textsc{gz2-galex} galaxies. The numbers of galaxies in each of these mass bins for each population are provided in Table \ref{massbins}. Here we utilise the GZ2 morphologies to weight by the vote fractions to combine across the different populations to produce smooth and disc dominated likelihood distributions. 

We apply the method outlined in Section \ref{starpy} to obtain a 2-dimensional likelihood distribution across the $[t_q, \tau]$ parameter space. We combine individual galaxy likelihood distributions within the \textsc{agn-host} and \textsc{inactive} galaxy samples, additionally weighting by GZ2 morphologies to produce quenching parameter likelihood distributions for both disc- and smooth-dominated galaxy populations in the $3$ mass bins defined in Table \ref{massbins}. We stress that this portion is purely for visualisation purposes and is no longer a Bayesian method. 


\begin{table}

\caption{Table showing the number of galaxies in each of the three mass bins for both the \textsc{agn-hosts} and \textsc{inactive} galaxy samples.}

\begin{tabular}{c|cc}

$10.25 < \log M_* [M_{\odot}] < 10.75$ & 630 (50.6\%)         & 46428 (37.7\%)      \\
$\log M_* > 10.75 M_{\odot}$           & 449 (36.1\%)         & 35618  (28.9\%)  \\\hline          
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

These 2-dimensional likelihoods are summed across each parameter axis and normalised to produce the one dimensional histograms shown in Figures \ref{time} and \ref{rate} for the quenching time, $t_q$ and exponential quenching rate, $\tau$, respectively. In each figure the summed 1-dimensional normalised probability distribution across the given parameter is shown for smooth and disc dominated galaxies across three mass bins for the \textsc{agn-host} and \textsc{inactive} samples. In Figure \ref{rate} the percentage likelihood in each region of quenching rate, shown by the dashed lines for rapid ($\tau < 1$ Gyr), intermediate ($1 < \tau ~\rm{[Gyr]} < 2$) and slow ($\tau > 2$ Gyr) quenching timescales are shown.

It is immediately apparent from Figures \ref{time} and \ref{rate} that there is a distinct difference between the distribution of likelihood for \textsc{agn-host} and \textsc{inactive} populations for both parameters. For the \textsc{inactive} sample, the likelihood for quenching at later times decreases with increasing mass; for the lower mass galaxies the quenching is roughly constant with time for both morphologies (right panel Figure \ref{time}). This is observational evidence of downsizing across the generic galaxy population whereby stars in massive galaxies form first and quench early \citep{Cowie96, Thomas10}. We do not expect to see traces of past AGN activity in the likelihood of the currently \textsc{inactive} population as any effects will be smeared out across the population.

\caption{Likehood distribution for the quenching time, $t_q$ parameter normalised so that the areas under the curves are equal. \textsc{agn-host} (left) and \textsc{inactive} (right) galaxies are split into low (top), medium (middle) and high (bottom) mass for smooth (red dashed) and disc (blue solid) galaxies. A low value of $t_q$ corresponds to the early Universe and a high value to the recent Universe.}
\label{time}
\end{figure}

At all masses, the distribution of likelihood for the \textsc{agn-host} population across the quenching time $t_q$ parameter (left panels of Figure \ref{time}), is different from that of the inactive galaxies (right panels of Figure \ref{time}). Recent quenching of \textsc{agn-host} galaxies is the dominant history across all masses, particularly for low mass galaxies. However, this effect is dampened in higher mass galaxies where quenching at earlier times also has significant likelihood.

The distribution of likelihoods for the rate of quenching, $\tau$, in Figure \ref{rate}, show the likelihood for rapid quenching ($\tau < 1 ~\rm{Gyr}$) decreases for the \textsc{inactive} population of increasing mass (see percentage likelihoods in the right hand panels of Figure \ref{rate}) and the likelihood for slow quenching ($\tau> 2 ~\rm{Gyr}$) increases for the \textsc{inactive} disc population with increasing mass.

These trends in the distribution of likelihood of the rate of quenching are also seen for the \textsc{agn-host} population; the likelihood for rapid quenching decreases with increasing mass for both smooth and disc dominated galaxies, but the overall distribution of the likelihood is very different. 

The likelihood distribution for the \textsc{agn-host} galaxies shows evidence for the dominance of rapid, recent quenching having occurred across the entire population. 



\section{Discussion}

The differences between the distribution of likelihood for the \textsc{agn-host} and \textsc{inactive} galaxy populations reveal that AGN have a significant effect on the SFH of its host galaxy. Both recent, rapid quenching and early, slow quenching are found in the likelihood distribution of the \textsc{agn-host} population. 


As well as the evidence for downsizing in the \textsc{inactive} population (Figure \ref{time}), we can also see its effect on the \textsc{agn-host} population. Although recent quenching is the dominant history, quenching at earlier times has significant likelihood, increasing with mass. These galaxies may have been affected by downsizing earlier in life with the current AGN also having an effect on the SFR through feedback, causing a recent, rapid quench of any residual star formation. 

\cite{Torbra09} model the effects of negative AGN feedback on a typical early type (i.e. smooth) galaxy and find the time between the current galaxy age, $t_{gal}$ and the time that the feedback began $t_{AGN}$, peaks at $t_{gal} - t_{AGN} \sim 0.85 ~\rm{Gyr}$. This agrees with the location of the peak in Figure \ref{time} for low mass galaxies, where the difference between the peak of the likelihood and the average age of the population (calculated from the redshift and assuming all galaxies form at $t=0$) is $\sim0.83 ~\rm{Gyr}$. This implies that this dominant recent quenching history is caused directly by AGN feedback, as opposed to the AGN being a consequence of an alternative quenching mechanism.

The black dashed lines show the separation between rapid ($\tau < 1.0$ Gyr), intermediate ($1.0 < \tau ~\rm{[Gyr]} < 2.0$) and slow ($\tau > 2.0$ Gyr) quenching timescales with the percentage likelihood distribution in each region for disc (blue) and smooth (red) populations. A small (large) value of $\tau$ corresponds to a rapid (slow) quench.}
\label{rate}
\end{figure}

If a slowly `dying' or `dead' galaxy has an infall of gas either through a minor merger, galaxy interaction or environmental change, this can trigger further star formation and feed the central black hole, igniting an AGN \citep{Kav14}. In turn this AGN can then quench the recent boost in star formation. This track is similar to the evolution history theorised for blue ellipticals \citep{Kav13, McIntosh14, Haines15}. As for the disc galaxies, this preference for slower evolution timescales follows from the ideas of previously isolated discs evolving slowly by the Kennicutt-Schmidt \citep{Schmidt59, Kennicutt97} law which can then undergo an interaction or merger to reinvigorate star formation and feed the central black hole. The difference between the \textsc{agn-host} and \textsc{inactive} population distribution of likelihood in Figure \ref{rate} for the rate of quenching, $\tau$, therefore tells a story of gas reservoirs. 

%\cite{Sme2015} speculate that rapid quenching rates could be attributed to mergers of galaxies, therefore we expect the trend of increasing likelihood for rapid quenching rates with increasing mass for the \textsc{inactive} population, as mergers are thought to be responsible for creating the most massive smooth galaxies \citep{Con03, SdMH05, Hopkins08}. 

%Similarly we also expect the trend of increasing likelihood for slow quenching rates with increasing mass as \cite{Sme2015} attributed slower quenching histories to secular (non-violent) evolution of isolated galaxies \citep{KK04, Cisternas11} which are often lower in mass \citep{Varela04, Bamford09} due to their isolation from other galaxies and therefore any potential gas reservoirs. 
 
The trends with likelihood of $\tau$ in Figure \ref{rate} are similar for the \textsc{agn-host} and \textsc{inactive} populations but the overall distribution is very different. The likelihood for rapid quenching decreases with increasing mass for both smooth and disc dominated \textsc{agn-host} populations. There is also more dominance of slower quenching timescales in the higher mass AGN population across both morphologies. It appears that the most massive disc galaxies, with the most massive gas reservoirs, evolve with a slow quench of star formation through the Kennicutt-Schmidt law and also have enough gas to feed the central black hole to trigger a current AGN \citep{Varela04, Em15}. This challenges the typical merger-driven theory for the co-evolution of the most luminous black holes and their host galaxies.

Conversely, rapid quenching, perhaps caused by the AGN itself through negative feedback, is the most dominant history for low mass galaxies with lower gravitational potentials which allow gas to be expelled more easily (or heated by the AGN) across the entire galaxy \citep{Torbra09}. Rapid quenching is particularly dominant for low-to-medium mass smooth galaxies. \cite{Sme2015} speculate that rapid quenching rates could be attributed to mergers of galaxies, which are thought to be responsible for creating the most massive smooth galaxies \citep{Con03, SdMH05, Hopkins08}. This dominance of rapid quenching supports the idea that a merger, having caused a morphological transformation, could also trigger an AGN in these smooth galaxies \citep{Sch2014}. This rapid quenching is still apparent but at a lower likelihood across both morphologies in higher mass galaxies, which have larger potentials, making it more difficult for the AGN to have an impact on the galaxy wide SFR \citep{Ish12, Zinn13}. 

For the medium mass \textsc{agn-host} population we see a bimodal distribution of likelihood between these two dominant quenching histories, highlighting the strength of this method which is capable of detecting such variation in the SFHs across a population of galaxies. 
\\
\\
We have used morphological classifications from the Galaxy Zoo 2 project to determine the morphology-dependent star formation histories of a population of $1,244$ Type 2 Seyfert AGN host galaxies in comparison to an inactive galaxy population via a Bayesian analysis of an exponentially declining star formation history model. We determined the most likely parameters for the quenching onset time, $t_q$ and quenching timescale $\tau$ and find clear differences in the combined population likelihoods between inactive and AGN host galaxy populations. We have demonstrated a clear dependence of a galaxy currently hosting an AGN and its SFR. There is strong evidence for downsizing in massive inactive galaxies, which appears as a secondary effect in AGN host galaxies. The dominant quenching mechanism for AGN host galaxies is rapid, recent quenching, demonstrating the importance of AGN feedback across the host galaxy population.
